I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that–lacking zero–they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs. (Robert Firth) Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter. (Eric Raymond) For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless.

They are, in short, a perfect match. (Bill Bryson)
